<h3 style="text-align: left;">Types of Returns</h3>
Returns can often be a complicated and time-consuming process. In order to make things simpler for you, we classify returns under two basic headings:
<ul>
	<li>RTO â€“ Return to Origin</li>
	<li>DTO â€“ Delivered to Origin</li>
</ul>

<h3 style="text-align: left;">How does it works?</h3>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1030" src="http://localhost:8081/paytmbigbo/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/flow-chart-open-file1.jpg" alt="flow-chart-open-file" width="1004" height="760" />

&nbsp;

The process explained aboveÂ has certain exceptions which can be understoodÂ as below:-

1. For certain low valued products, Paytm refunds the customer without arranging a pickup. In such cases the Seller does not bear any costs.

<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-710" src="http://localhost:8081/paytmbigbo/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/211.jpg" alt="2" width="1000" height="800" />

2. At times our courier partners mayÂ not be available for pickups, or the area might not be within serviceable limits. In such cases, the customer self-ships the return. Paytm credits the courier charges to customer and debits the merchant.
