Paytm takes pride in offering youÂ the fastest payment cycle. We have ensured that payments are made thrice a week for sales done by you. Payouts are done on Mondays, Wednesdays &amp; Fridays.

&nbsp;
<h3>How wouldÂ you know?</h3>
Once the order changes to '<strong>Delivered</strong>' status, you will get a payment e-mail Â from us. An attachedÂ PDF invoice gives you an idea of your order &amp; your earnings.

Please note that the payout is Â made after deducting sum of marketplace commission + payment gateway charges + Logistics (LMD partner) + penalty if any from your selling price .

The funds are transferred in yourÂ bank account. Please allow 2-3 working days for the amount to reflect in your account as banks normally take that to process them.
<h3>Let's explain further:</h3>
Examples
