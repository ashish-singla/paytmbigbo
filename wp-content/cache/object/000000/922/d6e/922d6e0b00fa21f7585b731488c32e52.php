While adding a product name, you should follow the below guidelines.
<ol>
	<li>Do not make use of misleading keywords that do not speak for your product. For example when describing Apple iPhone 5S 32 GB - Do not write Apple smartphone Apple iPhone 5S 32 GB.</li>
	<li>Do not stuff keywords. For Apple iPhone 5S , ¬†say Apple iPhone 5S 32GB and not Apple iPhone- iPhone 5S 32 GB.</li>
	<li>Do not use special characters(^, ~, ‚Ñ¢,¬•, ¬©,¬Æ,¬ª) , punctuation marks(!,. : ; ‚Äò‚Äô ‚Äò?) or asterisks (*) as this would affect low visibility in search results</li>
	<li>Always check for grammar and do a spell check.</li>
	<li>Avoid using acronyms or abbreviations (For example write Hewlett-Packard and not HP) as many customers will not understand this.</li>
	<li>Do not use ‚Äú100% genuine‚Äù or ‚ÄúOriginal‚Äù words in product title.</li>
	<li>Always follow searchable keyword that describe your product truly.For example use iphone and not Apple smartphone.</li>
	<li>Be sure to use the correct spellings, always use title case that is the first letter of ¬†each word should be in uppercase.

</ol>
