With this managing customer returns will become much easier.

Below are some of the most frequently asked questions around Return Processing Centre which will help you understand this process in detail.

<b>What is RPC?</b>

A Returns Processing Center is a physical hub where the merchandise returned by the customer is brought for quality check before it is dispatched further to the merchant.

As per the new Paytm policy, items that are returned by a customer will be sent to Paytmâ€™s Returns Processing Center (RPC).

The products will be quality checked against the customer's complaint and if the customer's complaint is validated, the product will be sent back to the seller and debit would be marked to the seller's account.

If Paytm feels that the products received at the RPC are not in a condition to be sent back to the seller, the product will not be sent back to the seller and NO debit will be marked to the seller's account.

Paytm's decision, in either case, shall be treated as final.

<b> #How do I know if my shipment will go to the RPC?</b>

It is Paytmâ€™s prerogative to decide which shipments will go through the RPC. If your shipment is assigned to the RPC, you will get the following content in your email with â€˜Yesâ€™ mentioned under the â€˜RPC Assignedâ€™ column:

â€œThis is to inform you that as per our logistics partnerâ€™s report, following items have been picked from the customer for return.Â Please find below summary of the picked items.â€

<a href="http://paytm.com/sellers/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2015/10/table-1_-blogpost-27-10-15.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-521" src="http://paytm.com/sellers/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2015/10/table-1_-blogpost-27-10-15.jpg" alt="table-1_-blogpost-27-10-15" width="659" height="97" /></a>If â€˜Noâ€™ is mentioned under the â€˜RPC Assignedâ€™ column, then that particular shipment will not go through the RPC. Such shipments will be sent directly to the seller's address.

A â€˜RPC Assignedâ€™ flag will also be visible to the seller on the Seller Panel if the shipment is assigned to the RPC.

<strong>#How much time will be taken by the RPC for QC?</strong>

At RPC, every item will be quality checked thoroughly to validate customer complaint. The RPC will take a maximum ofÂ 72Â hoursÂ to process the shipments.
<strong>#What if my item is â€˜QC failedâ€™ at RPC?</strong>

â€˜QC failed or QC rejectedâ€™ implies that Paytm felt that the product was not in a condition to be sent back to the seller.

If the item is QC failed at RPC, we will not send the item back you and the item will be liquidated from the RPC. The status of such items will be shown as â€˜Liquidatedâ€™ in the â€˜Returnsâ€™ tab of Seller Panel. No debit will be marked to you in such cases.

The following communication shall be received by you in this case:

â€œWe have found that the following product that was returned by the customer, was not in a condition to be sent back to you and hence is being retained by Paytm. No debit will be marked to your account for this productâ€

<b>#What if my item is â€˜QC passedâ€™ at RPC?</b>

â€˜QC passed or QC acceptedâ€™ implies that the customerâ€™s complaint was genuine. Such shipments will be sent back to you and shipping details of such shipments will be communicated to you once the shipments are dispatched from the RPC.

A debit will be marked to your account in such cases once the shipment is delivered and the following communication will be sent to you in this case:

â€œThe following items returned by the customer have been quality checked at RPC. We have found that the customer's complaint was valid and hence the product is being sent back to youâ€.

<b>#What if I want my shipment to be assigned to an RPC?</b>

The prerogative of mapping a seller to the RPC/sending a shipment to the RPC shall lie with Paytm. You can raise a request to process your shipments through the RPC via merchant helpdesk (email: <a href="mailto:merchant.helpdesk@paytm.com">merchant.helpdesk@paytm.com</a>) but Paytmâ€™s decision in this regard shall remain final.

<b>#When will I receive my product if it is QC passed?</b>

Once the Item has passed the quality check and has been shipped from RPC, you will get a notification about the shipments dispatched through an email. you should receive such item(s) at your warehouse within 21 days of reverse pickup from the customer.
